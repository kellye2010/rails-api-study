# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
<!-- Models are Ruby classes. They store and validate data sent from the controller, as well as send this info back to the controller. -->
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
<!-- The controller parses request sent from the web server and pases this information between the model and the view -->
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
<!-- A rails router reads what is passed to it and sends it to the correct resource controller action. Controller actions for a resourceful router include create, read, update, and delete actions. -->
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
<!--
Client makes GET request to a particular URL triggered by an action in the web browser.
The browser sends this request to the web server, where the web server determines which controller to use. Once sent to the GET controller, the controller interprets the request, decides what information needs to be sent and passed back from the model, then the same for the view. Once thi is complete, the controller returns the response body to the web server. The server sends this information to the user.
The GET request may return the HTML display of the URL, or whatever information the specified GET request was triggered to return.
 -->
```
